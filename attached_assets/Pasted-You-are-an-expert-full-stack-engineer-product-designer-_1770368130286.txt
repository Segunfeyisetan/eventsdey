You are an expert full-stack engineer + product designer. Build “Eventsdey Nigeria” — a world-class, mobile-first web app for event venue discovery and booking, inspired by https://www.eventsdey.com but redesigned to be extremely intuitive and user friendly on mobile.

LAUNCH CONTEXT
- Launch country: Nigeria
- Currency default: NGN
- Payments: Paystack ONLY (cards + bank transfer where available) with secure webhooks
- Regions: Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt as seeded locations (expandable)

PRODUCT PRINCIPLES (DO NOT IGNORE)
- Mobile-first UX: thumb-friendly, big tap targets, minimal typing
- 3-click path: Search → View → Request/Book
- Make every page feel “guided” (clear next step)
- Use progressive disclosure (hide advanced filters until needed)
- Fast: optimize images, skeleton loaders, cached search results
- Accessibility: good contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation

CORE USER FLOWS (MUST BE GREAT)
1) Find a venue:
   - Home search card: Location + Date + Guests + Budget
   - Results: list + optional map, smart filters
2) Venue details:
   - Sticky “Check availability” / “Request booking” button
   - Gallery, capacity, amenities, rules, location, reviews
3) Booking:
   - Select date/time slot
   - Choose add-ons (optional)
   - Pay deposit or full amount via Paystack
   - Confirmation with invoice/receipt
4) Messaging:
   - In-app chat between planner and venue holder
5) Reviews:
   - Only allowed after completed booking

ROLES & PERMISSIONS (CRITICAL)
- ADMIN: can add/edit/remove ANY venue, approve/verify venues, manage disputes, configure fees, manage users, feature listings.
- VENUE_HOLDER: can add/edit/remove ONLY their venues from their dashboard, set availability, pricing, media, and respond to booking requests.
- PLANNER (customer): can search, book, message, review.
Admin must also be able to create a venue WITHOUT an owner, then later assign it to a venue holder.

IMPLEMENTATION ORDER
1) DB + Drizzle migrations + seed (demo venues)
2) Auth + RBAC middleware
3) Venue CRUD + search filters + venue details page
4) Availability + booking flow + booking statuses
5) Paystack integration (initialize, verify, webhook)
6) Dashboards: Venue Holder + Admin
7) Messaging + Reviews + Disputes
8) Polish UX: guided flows, skeletons, empty states, error handling

DELIVERABLES
- Monorepo:
  /apps/web
  /apps/api
  /packages/ui (theme + components)
  /packages/api-client (typed client)
- Seed an admin user + a venue holder + 10 venues in Nigeria
- Clear README with “Run locally on Replit” + env vars
- Make it production-grade with validation, security, rate limiting

Start by generating the repository, then implement backend + web UI first.
